# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Your repository is ready!

Your local git repository has been initialized and all files have been committed.

## Next Steps:

1. **Create the GitHub repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `Giuli's Website`
   - Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **After creating the repo, run these commands:**

```bash
cd "/Users/kerellosabdelmalak/Development/giuli blog"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Giuli-s-Website.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Alternative: If you want to use SSH instead:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Giuli-s-Website.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Your files are already committed and ready to push!

All your website files have been committed to the local repository. Once you add the remote and push, everything will be on GitHub.
